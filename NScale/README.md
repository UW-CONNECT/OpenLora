## NScale in Python

NScale. But in python. ECE 901 Spring 2021

### Dependencies

We're using python 3

I'm assuming we'll need numpy at some point, so do the following to setup
the environment:

```
make venv
```

Before you run the program do the following:

```
. venv/bin/activate
```
